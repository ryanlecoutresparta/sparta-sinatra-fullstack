## Sparta Sinatra Fullstack Homework

##### Description: I created a fullstack application using Ruby with Sinatra and models. It lists names that are from a database from Mockaroo, and the user can edit, delete and add to it. Each name is then linked to a specific sport, and these sports are within another table in the database. The user can edit, delete and add to the sports section too.

## Challenges:

1. Figuring out the correct way to link multiple tables in a database together.

2. Ensuring that there were no errors, which becomes particularly fiddly when you introduce another table to the model!

## Takeaways:

1. Increased understanding of databases and SQL.

2. Increased my ability to troubleshoot and locate bugs.

## Instructions on How to Download:
1. Enter the GitHub repo.
2. Copy the SSH to clipboard.
3. In your command line, enter the folder you wish to insert the files.
4. Type ‘git clone’ followed by pasting the SSH into the command line.
5. Open the code in your chosen text editor, such as Atom.
6. Initiate the seed file in your terminal to create the database by typing 'psql -d people -f seed.sql'.
7. Type in 'rackup' to your terminal and open 'localhost:9292/' in your browser.
